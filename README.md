## Technologies Used

- Python 3 (Standard Library only)
  - `json` for data persistence
  - `datetime` for timestamping emails
  - No external dependencies required

---

## Notes

- This is a **terminal-based simulation**. It does not send real emails.
- For learning and prototyping purposes (no encryption or password hashing).
- Data is stored **locally** in `users.json` and `inboxes.json`.
